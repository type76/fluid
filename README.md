# fluid
I want to make [this](https://github.com/PavelDoGreat/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/) beautiful thing more useful and keep maximum visual feedback.

Added overlay dom element [hero], keyboard controls, smokey trails, moved multipleSplats function.

#To Do
Three.js integration
Optional canvas hero (not a dom element)
Collider objects/walls
